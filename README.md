pmird is an R package that has the aim to provide a comprehensive and
easily to access data collection of mid infrared spectra (MIR) of peat
and related material (for example peat forming vegetation or DOM).

pmird is designed as community-based project, meaning that everybody can
contribute and benefit from this project. Learn more about [why you
should
contribute](https://henningte.github.io/pmird/articles/a01-Why-to-contribute.html)
to pmird and [how you can use the
data](https://henningte.github.io/pmird/articles/a05-How-to-access-data.html)\!

pmird is part of my PhD project. I want to be fully transparent on [what
I plan to do with the
data](https://henningte.github.io/pmird/articles/a02-What-I-plan-to-do-with-the-data.html).
