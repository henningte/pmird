pmird is an R package that has two major aims:

1.  Provide a comprehensive and easily to access data collection of mid
    infrared spectra (MIR) of peat and related material (for example
    peat forming vegetation or dissolved organic matter).

2.  Combine this with additional data on peat characteristics, such as
    bulk density or carbon content, to support the development of MIR
    prediction models for these characteristics.

pmird is a community-based project, where everybody can contribute and
access data. Learn more about [how you can use the
data](https://henningte.github.io/pmird/articles/a05-How-to-access-data.html)\!
