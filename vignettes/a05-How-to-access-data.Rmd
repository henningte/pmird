```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",

Data will be publicly accessible after November 2022, when I plan to finish my PhD project and publish the data compendium. A link to a repositorium with pmird will be made available here.

pmird will contain functions to make the data easily accessible and help to cite the retrieved data.
